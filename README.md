Basically, this project implements a machine learning model to classify SONAR signals as either a Rock or a Mine using Logistic Regression with hyperparameter optimization. The project is built in Google Colab and uses the SONAR dataset from Kaggle. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and a single-sample prediction with a probability plot.
